Lyrics of The A Team by Ed Sheeran :[Verse 1]White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
[Pre-Chorus]And they say
She's in the Class A TeamStuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastriesAnd they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
[Chorus 1]'Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of gramsAnd she don't want to go outside tonightAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another manIt's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
[Verse 2]Ripped gloves, raincoatTried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throatCall girl, no phone
[Pre-Chorus]And they say
She's in the Class A TeamStuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastriesAnd they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
[Chorus 1]'Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of gramsAnd she don't want to go outside tonightAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another manIt's too cold outside
For angels to fly
[Bridge]An angel will die
Covered in whiteClosed eyes and hopin' for a better lifeThis time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
[Pre-Chorus]And they say
She's in the Class A TeamStuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastriesAnd they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
[Chorus 2]And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonightAnd in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another manIt's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to flyFor angels to die> song_lyrics("Let Me Love You")
Lyrics of Let Me Love You by Mario :[Intro - Mario]
Mmmm ..... Mmmmm.... Yeah....Mmmmm....Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Mmmm...Yeah....Mmmm..... Yeah, Yeah
[Verse 1: Mario]
Baby I just don't get it, do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories, you know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
[Pre-Refrain: Mario]
If I was ya man baby you'd
Never worry bout what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
Fistful of diamonds hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you, you are
[Refrain: Mario]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you
Love you
Yeah, Listen
[Verse 2: Mario]Your true beautyâ€™s description; look so good that it hurtsYou're a dime plus 99 and it's a shame, don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go, they stop and stare, cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, out of control baby you know
[Pre-Refrain: Mario]
If I was ya man baby you'd
Never worry bout what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
Fistful of diamonds hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you, you are
[Refrain: Mario]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection

[Bridge: Mario]
You deserve better girl (You know you deserve better)
We should be together girl (Baby)
With me and you it's whatever girl, hey
So can we make this thing ours?

Make me your selection (selection)
Show you the way love's supposed to be, yeah
Let me love you, that's all you need, baby Lyrics of Let Me Love You by DJ Snake featuring Justin Bieber :NA> song_lyrics(title="Treat You Better")
Lyrics of Treat You Better by Shawn Mendes :[Verse 1]I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
[Bridge]
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down
[Chorus]
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can>
